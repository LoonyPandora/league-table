2011-12 Barclays Premier League
===============================

This table shows the table for each day of 2011-12 Barclays Premier League season.

This was a particular painful season for me as a Manchester United supporter. Neverthless, I will re-live this season for the sake of showing some JS skills.


Key Points
----------

 - The date will increment a single day at a time, and update the table with the results of matches played on that day.
 - When a team moves up the table, the will be highlighted in green.
 - When a team moves down the table, they will be highlighted in red.
 - Teams are sorted by a) points b) goal difference c) goals scored.
 - The animation will last a total of 60 seconds.
 - Works in modern browsers.
 - No 3rd party JavaScript.
 - Normalize.css is used as a CSS reset. Usually I would choose bootstrap, but I wanted to demonstrate that I can work without heavy CSS frameworks.
 - Looks roughly like the wireframe below
